#This file allows specific items to be store or sell or leave
#Syntax: <item name> <minimum keep amount in inventory> <storage-auto flag> <sell-auto flag>
#
#Ex. The example below will sell all jellopies, and store all knifes
#
#Jellopy 0 0 1
#Knife 0 1 0
#
#The item name isn't case sensitive.  Only items found in this file will be stored or sold.
#
#If storage and sell flags are 1, Kore will do storage first (unless storage is full) then sell
#
#Kore will not sell or store equipped items.  For example, if you're using a knife and you
#have a line to auto-sell all knives, kore will sell any extras it picks up, not the knife it's
#using.
